# Gefen matrix controller
I made this device to remotely control the outputs assignment of Gefen Matrix: 8×8 DVIKVM DL Matrix
It allow to switch inputs from main source to backup source, you can just switch the GUI or all outputs.
The controller send Telnet command to switch outputs ( the preset recall doesn’t work very good)
